Pinging friends in Telegram chat by their name!

Use `/set Bob` with a reply or `/unset Bob` to set or unset an alias (aka
nomi), send `/list` to list all nomis and write `@all` to ping everyone.

Launch by:

	% python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
	% export TOKEN="1234:abcdef"
	% python bot.py

LMDB is used and a file with a database will be created.
